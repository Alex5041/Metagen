# Defining functions in language

It seems natural to shorten embedded functions amount as much as possible (and write declarations in created language), but firstly I added all of them through kotlin. Maybe it happened because I was writing my own all-in-one parser-interpreter which was primitive (yet usable) and adding function parsing and evaluation was overwhelming. This realisation coupled together with realisation that I cannot embed all the functions in the world was a main reason for using existing interpreter/algorithm (grabbed latter because I didn't like code for AST evaluation generated by Antlr).
