# Class

Class must have **a name**, **a superclass** and **a block of properties**:

An example of a class declaration:

``` Java 
class name : superclass {
    variableName = variableValue
    parent.overrideName = overrideValue
    ...
}
```

*Note: classes can be derived from ones that are declared in a program and from [base classes](BasicTypes.md)*

There are special property classes. Some base classes have their own special property classes, such as 'points' array in Polyline.
