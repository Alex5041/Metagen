# Non functional

This language has these traits:

* **Extensibility** - modular evaluation architecture might be extended by adding new operators or rewriting (almost)

* **Ease of use** - simple structure, familiar keywords will hopefully help users grasp the concept.

This language does NOT have these traits:

* Speed - ReDI is written with Kotlin, so it's slower than Kotlin
